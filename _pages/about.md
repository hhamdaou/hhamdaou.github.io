I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Physics Department at Uppsala University. My research focuses on the ATLAS experiment, located at CERN near Geneva. ATLAS is a detector that collects the results of collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator ever built.

We are living through one of the most exciting times in the history of fundamental physics. The LHC allows us, for the first time, to explore the energy scale of the tera-electron-volt (TeV), where we expect to find new fundamental physics. This includes the possible creation of dark matter in the laboratory, the discovery of extra dimensions of space, and Supersymmetry.

We have already discovered a new particle—the Higgs boson—which explains the origin of mass.
