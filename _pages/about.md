I'am a Postdoctpral Researcher at Uppsala University physics department . My research focuses on the ATLAS experiment located at CERN near Geneva. ATLAS is a detector that collect the results of collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by far the most powerful particle accelerator ever built. We are living through one of the most exciting times in the history of fundamental physics. Indeed the LHC allows us to reach for the first time the energy scale of the Tera-electron-volt where we expect the presence of new fundamental physics, such as the creation of dark matter in the laboratory, the discovery of a new dimension of space and Supersymmetry. We have already discovered a new particle, the Higgs boson, which explains the origin of mass.
