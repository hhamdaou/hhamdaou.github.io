I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Physics Department at Uppsala University. My research focuses on the ATLAS experiment at CERN, which records the results of collisions produced by the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the most powerful particle accelerator in the world.

The LHC allows us to explore energies where entirely new phenomena may appear, including dark matter, extra dimensions of space, or signs of Supersymmetry. Already, we have discovered the Higgs boson, the particle that explains the origin of mass.

I work on searches for Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs), hypothetical heavy particles that could reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model.

I also maintain the internal TOAST web application, which is used by the Trigger group to store stable beam runs and it gather useful and automatic tool as replacement for wiki page.
